## *Description*
As in the economic environment, the technology market also struggles to create complex nomenclatures to describe simple things.

Who wasn't scared when heard for the first-time terms like Kubernetes, Container, CLI, IDE, Cloud, serverless function? That is why I created Algo Education.

Algo Education is a project that aims to explain in a simple way the concept and operation of some of the algorithms that developers can use.


## *Technologies*
- Javascript
- react
- Styled Component
- CSS
- Heroku


## *Authors*

Regardless of which one you choose, there will be a section at the bottom of the page where you can learn more about the selected algorithm class and explanations of existing algorithms.
